# Food Finder

Below link is hosted web app

http://alicefoodfinder.azurewebsites.net/

This web application is to recommend food or drink based on user's face.
I used face detect API from Microsoft cognitive service to analyse user's age and gender.
From the photo uploaded by user, it allocates user into a age-gender group

I have implemented Sweet Alert and Fakeloader jQuery.
Sweet Alert appears once the user click "Go Back" button from /drink.html or /meal.html pages.
Also, Fakeloader appears when the user tries to move to other pages.
Each page should have different effects.
